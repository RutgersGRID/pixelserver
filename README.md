# PixelServer
> An IoT interactive pixel wall implementation

This project is an implementation of an LED wall controlled through the internet with the use of node, vue.js, johnny-five.js, and a microcontroller. This repository is the server side code that handles the communication between the LED wall and the users through socket.io. For the code handling the hardware implementation, please go [here](https://github.com/RutgersUniversityVirtualWorlds/pixelwall).

## Installing / Getting started
## TO DO

## Developing

### TO DO
### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)


### Prerequisites

What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
Roughly, the version number represents MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where an increment is
    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Configuration

### TO DO
Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

### TO DO
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

### TO DO
Explain your code style and show how to check it.
